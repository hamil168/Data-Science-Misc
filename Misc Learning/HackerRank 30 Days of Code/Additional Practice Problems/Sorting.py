Write a function

def solution(A)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct
 values in array A.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].
For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:

 A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.




RESULTS:
100% Correctness
0% Performance (scored O(N^2) when needed O(n log n)

def solution(A):
    # write your code in Python 3.6

    # Use a bubble sort.

    # Then get length of the final array

        for i in range(len(A)-j):  # -1 b/c we compare 2 elements
