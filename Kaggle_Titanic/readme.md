Kaggle Titanic Notebooks.

In the process of tidying up and adding my Titantic Kaggle work.

The purpose of this project was to gain experience in python while exploring the ways this data set can be examined and manipulated. My coding skills have improved relative to my first project (the Microsoft/EdX capstone) and I am learning more and more ways to use Python.

Currently:
1) Data Exploration: Initial Exploration of the data
2) Data Workup: Further exploration of the data and decide how to process features and which others to create

In Progress:

3) Pipeline
4) Modelling
